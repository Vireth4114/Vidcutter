## An automatic editor for your Celeste map clears

Currently it's a WIP and I need to be able to
 - Select a folder where the raw footage is stored (currently %USERPROFILE%/Videos)
 - Select multiple videos to edit
 - Select only a level to cut in one or multiple videos that may contain multiple levels
 - Show levels that are in the videos and change the output name
 - Change the output folder
 - Do other things idk
