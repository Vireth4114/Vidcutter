## An automatic editor for your map clears

Currently its a WIP and I need to be able to
 - Select a folder where the raw footage is stored (currently %USERPROFILE%/Videos)
 - Select a video to edit (currently takes the last one from the folder)
 - Select multiple videos to edit
 - Select only a level to cut in one or multiple videos that may contain multiple levels
 - Show levels that are in the videos and change the output name
 - Change the output folder
